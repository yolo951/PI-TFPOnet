### PINN-type

This section of the experiment focuses on a separate equation, akin to the PINN framework, and is therefore designated as PINN-type. We consider this part of the experiment to be preliminary and not sufficiently innovative to warrant inclusion in the article.
### DeepONet-type

This section addresses a parameterized equation, paralleling the DeepONet approach, and is referred to as DeepONet-type. The code in this part corresponds to the numerical experiments presented in the article.
